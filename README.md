# Initial Configuration
These scripts are a fork of txoof's repo 'piconfig'
github.com/txoof/piconfig

Each one goes through the steps for configuring a new debian-based system.

For now it includes scripts for Debian, which I use on most of my VMs, and Raspberry Pi.

This includes pulling dotfiles from my repo, and applying necessary changes to convert them from Arch to Debian.

It also includes setting the hostname and a static IP address, as well as instructions for adding a sudo user on Debian.
